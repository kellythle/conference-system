===[List of Extensions]===

# Note: Our group has only 7 members. Though it shows we have 8 members on MarkUs, there is one member that never
show up. So we chose 3 optional extensions.

1. Mandatory extensions
    (a) Multiple types of events: Includes normal event (1 speaker), panel (2 speakers), and party (no speakers).
    (b) Events can be canceled by at least one organizer.
    (c) VIP user:
        - special code required to create VIP accounts
        - can message any organizer/speaker/VIP, or attendee if they're friends
        - custom UI (slightly nicer)
        - show friend request at top
    (d) Organizers can create other users including: Attendee, Speaker, and VIP.
    (e) Events and Rooms have maximum capacity.
2. Optional extensions
    (a) Enhance the user's messaging experience by allowing them to "mark as unread",
    delete, or archive messages after reading them.
        -Organizers can view message garbage bin--messages deleted from both sender and receiver
        inboxes--and clear it.
    (b) Allows user to request events by a specific day, time or speaker,and requested events. For speakers,
    they can also see events that they speaks.
    (c) Separate Room as an Entity from Event. So room now has more features other than capacity and room number.
3. Our own extensions
    (a) Advance password restrictions.
    (b) Allow speakers to sign up for events (except the events they are speaking).
    (c) Friend list system.
    (d) Game System. Allows user to play some math games.
