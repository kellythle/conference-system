===[Design Patterns in our Project]===
1. Factory:
In our code, we use factory design pattern to create the user account. As you can see, we create a interface named
AccountFactory in the use case level, coming with subclasses which can create the exact user account we want.

OrganizerFactory -> generate Organizer
SpeakerFactory -> generate Speaker
AttendeeFactory -> generate Attendee
VIPFactory -> generate VIP

2. Builder
3. Dependency injection
