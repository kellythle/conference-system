# Conference System
Our class was given instructions to design a program that allows people at a conference (examples: a tech conference, a TED-style conference, 
an employment fair, etc.) to communicate with each other in very specific ways. There were three phases to this project.

In Phase 0, we designed a program that will allow Attendees to sign up for events and message each other. 

In Phase 1, we created our program that organized a tech conference, where there were organizers, speakers, 
and attendees. Each speaker could give one or more talks. Organizers decided when and where the talks will 
take place. Attendees could view the schedule of talks by time, title, or speaker. 

At the end of Phase 2, we had an app that allowed Organizers of a conference to plan the event, allowed Speakers at the event to learn 
the information they need to speak and communicate with the Attendees of their presentation, allowed Attendees to sign up for events and network 
with each other, and more.
